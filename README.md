# Covid-19-in-India-Dashboard-Analysis

I developed a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to analyze the spread and impact of Covid-19 in India. By integrating data from multiple sources and utilizing data blending techniques, I provided a detailed view of trends and patterns across various regions. The dashboard includes interactive maps to visualize state-wise case distribution, multi-line charts to track daily case progression, bar charts for comparing state-wise statistics, and donut charts to represent recovery and fatality ratios. This analysis offers valuable insights into the pandemicâ€™s trajectory, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and formulate effective response strategies.
